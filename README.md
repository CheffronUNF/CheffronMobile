## About Cheffron Mobile

This app is being made as a project for our Software Engineering class. We hope to create a social recipe app. Features will include the ability to create, share, and discover recipes as well as being able to award chefs (users) who create and share wonderful recipes.  

The discovery page lets you find recipes that fit your diet or how you feel that day. Don't want to go out and get ingredients? Enter the ingredients you have into your in-app "pantry" to get recipes you can make with what you have!
